# Python-Exercises
This repository, numerical-analysis-python, contains a series of Python programs that I wrote during the coursework Numerical Methods for Astrophysics, taught by Professor [Michela Mapelli](https://web.oapd.inaf.it/mapelli/). It focuses on applying numerical analysis techniques to solve a variety of problems commonly encountered in astrophysics. The programs cover methods such as root-finding, numerical integration, interpolation, differential equation solving, and matrix computations, providing practical implementations that bridge theoretical concepts with computational solutions. This repository serves as both a learning resource for students and enthusiasts of numerical methods in astrophysics and a reference library for implementing standard numerical techniques in Python. Each program includes clear explanations and comments to illustrate the applied method and its astrophysical context. If you need any help or have questions, please feel free to contact me.
